EmergeCommand shows the time (and/or date) in a fully configurable way, and can be used as a window to type commands in.<br>
      
<h2>Configuration of emergeCommand</h2>

To configure emergeCommand, Ctrl-right-click its window and click on Configure,<br>
      <br>
      
<img src="images/CommandConfigureMenu.png"><br>and you get the configuration dialog box below.<br>
      <br>
      
<img src="images/eCommandBoxGeneral.png" border="0">
      <br>
      <br>
The settings on the General tab allow you to:<br>
<ul>
    <li>snap the window position to the edges of the monitor and of the other windows,</li>
	<li>snap the size of the window to other windows next to it</li>
	<li>switch the &quot;clickable&quot; area from the window to whatever is behind it if you check Click Through and select Full.Important notes: To access the window's menu in this setting, you must Shift-Ctrl-right-click the window instead of just Ctrl-right-click. Likewise, to move it you must Shift-Ctrl-click the window, and to resize it you must Shift-Alt-click a border.</li>
    <li>or switch the &quot;clickable&quot; area from the window's background to whatever is behind it, but still keep the clock's text (and the border) themselves &quot;clickable&quot; if you check Click Through and select Background. Important notes: To access the applet's menu with this setting, you must Ctrl-right-click the text or the border, not the background. Likewise, to move the window you must either Ctrl-click the text or the border, and you still can resize the window by Alt-clicking a border.</li>
    <li>set the clock format (See the complete list in the Time/Date Format Variables and Codes section of the Documentation in the Emerge Desktop program group). You can also have nothing in this window, and use this applet for commands only.</li>
    <li>set the tooltip format (same as above),</li>
    <li>set the font, style and size (for color, see Font setting in the Style Editor on next page).</li>
    <li>let AutoComplete suggest previously typed commands as you type.</li></ul><br>The Position tab (picture 
      below) allows you to:<br>

      <ul>
        <li>anchor the window to 
        the monitor location of your choice,</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>set the window as always on the top, in normal 
        position, or always under other windows (ZPosition),</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>set the horizontal and 
        vertical alignments of the clock within the border, and</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>set the horizontal and 
        vertical alignments of the command within the 
      border.</li></ul><br>

<h2>Usage of emergeCommand</h2>

      <div style="display: block; text-align: left;">After clicking on the 
      emergeCommand window (depending on Click Through setting above), 
      which activates the cursor, you can type commands such as:<br>

      <ul>
        <li>any command that can 
        be entered in Window's &quot;Run&quot; window,</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Special Folders (i.e. 
        My Documents, My Computer, My Network Places, Control Panel, or Recycle 
        Bin),</li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>any of Emerge Desktop's Internal Commands 
        (listed in the Documentation in the Emerge Desktop program group), </li></ul>
      <ul>
        <li>the path of any folder, which will open 
        Explorer at that location.<br>
</li></ul></div>
      <p><br>
</p>
      <p>A convenient feature of 
      emergeCommand is that it allows the use of aliases, which are short texts 
      created by the user 
      to replace long 
      commands. <br>
</p>
      <p>These texts are entered 
      in the file &quot;cmd.txt&quot; located in the User Profile folder Application 
      Data\Emerge 
      Desktop\files.<br>
</p>
      <p>To open and edit this 
      file, right-click the desktop to open Emerge Desktop's Desktop menu, click on 
      Settings and Edit Aliases.</p>

<img src="images/AliasMenu.png">
      <p>The alias format is: .[alias text] [tab] 
      [actual command]</p>
      <p>Note that the alias text 
      has to be preceded by a period (.), and that when executing the alias you 
      must type the period as well.<br>
</p>
      <p>For example, to replace 
      the (very long) command &quot;C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe&quot; with the (very short) text 
      &quot;.ie&quot;,</p>
      <p>type in the cmd.txt file: 
      &quot;.ie[tab]c:\program files\internet explorer\iexplore.exe&quot; (where [tab] is the tab key, and without the 
      quotation marks). <br>
</p>
      <p>Save and close the 
      file.</p>
      <p>Now type &quot;.ie&quot; in 
      the emergeCommand window, and the Internet Explorer browser 
      opens.<br>
</p>
