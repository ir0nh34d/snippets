<h3>Changing the look of the windows</h3>

The Style Editor tab is shared by most Emerge Desktop applets.<br>

To open it (once you have Ctrl-right-clicked one of the windows and clicked on Configure as shown below), <br>
      <br>
<img src="images/StyleConfigureMenu.png">
      <br>
click on the Style Editor tab and you get the dialog box below.<br>
      <br>
<img src="images/StyleEditor1.png">

The settings on this tab can be saved as a "style" for each applet.<br>
      <br>
Each saved style is a file (with "eds" extension). The default style for emergeLauncher is "launcher.eds", for emergeTasks, "tasks.eds", etc.<br>
      <br>
After making settings changes that you want to keep, you can save them under a new style name by clicking on Save As.<br>
      <br>
Click on Load to switch to an other style.<br>
      <br>
A style can be shared by different applets. To load an existing style in an other applet, Ctrl-right-click on it and click on Load Style, click on the desired style and press OK.<br>
      <br>
To reload (update) a style after it has been changed (and saved) in another applet sharing the same style, right-click on the window of the applet not yet updated and click Reload Current Style, or wait until next reboot.<br>
      <br>
An other, more comprehensive way to keep settings is by saving them as a "theme", which is a set of styles and other Emerge Desktop settings.
They are discussed on the next page.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
Click on Gradient (picture below) to give the window background a
choice of different effects in Methods and gradient Colors underneath (Method
&gt; Solid = no gradient).<br>
      <br>
<img src="images/StyleEditor3.png">
      <br>
Click on Miscellaneous (picture below) for additional visual effects:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Checking Shadow adds a shadow behind the window,</li>
        <li>Checking Blur gives a blurred effect to the background of
the applets when the Opacity Setting of the Background is less than 100
(Vista and above), </li>
        <li>Values in Padding increase the distance between icons and
the window's edges,</li>
        <li>Values in Bevel adds a bevel around the background, with
choice of Flat, Raised or Sunken effects.</li>
</ul>

      <br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">The initial configuration of
Emerge Desktop was designed to show different possible visual effects:<br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
      <ul>
        <li>emergeLauncher (gray window) has gradient set at Solid, (i.e. no gradient, therefore the two&nbsp;Colors underneath have no effect), and Padding set at 4,</li>
        <li>emergeTasks (blue window) has Vertical gradient with Colors going from white to blue, and Padding set at 4,</li>
        <li>emergeTray (red window) has Horizontal gradient with Colors going from bright red to dark red, Interlaced checked, and Padding set at 4,</li>
        <li>emergeCommand (yellow window) has Diagonal gradient with Colors going from white to yellow, Bevel (Sunken) set at 3, and Border at 1.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
(Initial configuration of Emerge Desktop Release with black and white windows have all windows with same visual effects)<br>
