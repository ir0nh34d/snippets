<H1><IMG src="images/eD_icon_large.png"> <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)">Emerge Desktop</I> : The Basics</H1>

In its initial configuration, <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I>'s interface consists of:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>a group of several applets (applet meaning a small program), which looks deliberately like the Windows Explorer interface, and</LI>
<LI>two Desktop menus, which open by right-clicking and middle-clicking on the desktop.</LI></UL>

<H2>The applet windows</H2>

The Windows Explorer's &quot;taskbar&quot; across the bottom of the desktop has been replaced with windows (i.e. visible interface) of <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> applets.<BR>Each applet is very simple to reconfigure (color, position, functions, loading, etc.)
<BR><BR>They are, from left to right:<BR><BR><IMG src="images/taskbar.png"> 

<UL>
  <LI>The gray window: emergeLauncher, which lets you start programs by clicking on their respective icons,</LI>
  <LI>the blue window: emergeTasks, which shows the icons of running programs,</LI>
  <LI>the red window: emergeTray, which shows icons of system and program features running in the background, and</LI>
  <LI>the yellow window: emergeCommand, which shows the time and can be used to type commands in.</LI>
</UL><BR>
  
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: If you did not use an installer for <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> (Release 4.2.1 or later), but a posterior development build, the applet windows will have a common look and no colors. The instructions in this tutorial apply also to these later builds.<BR><BR>Below and in the next few pages, you will find out how to customize the position, look, functions, etc. of these and other <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> applets and their respective windows.<BR><BR>They are all independent of each other.<BR><BR>For example, to move one of the windows, press the Ctrl key, click on the window (the four-arrow cursor will appear) and drag it.<BR><BR><IMG src="images/move.png" border=0> <BR>To resize a window horizontally or vertically, press the Alt key, place the mouse cursor on one border of the window (the double-arrow cursor will appear) and drag it.<BR><BR><IMG src="images/resize.png" border=0> <BR>
<H2>The Desktop menus</H2>The &quot;Start&quot; button <IMG src="images/eD_icon.png"> (the 
<I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> icon on the left 
side of the gray emergeLauncher window) opens the RightClick Desktop 
menu.<BR><BR>It is optional to have it configured in emergeLauncher, as it can 
always be accessed by right-clicking anywhere on the desktop.<BR><BR>Click on 
the &quot;Start&quot; button or right-click anywhere on the desktop and the menu 
appears:<BR><BR><IMG src="images/RightMenu.png" border=0><BR>
<BR>Among familiar Windows menu items, 
<B>Settings</B> and <B>Help</B> are<I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)">
<B>Emerge Desktop</B></I>'s own menus.<BR><BR>
<B>Settings</B> consists of: <BR><BR>1. 
<B>Configure</B>, which has two tabs:<BR><BR>On the <B>General</B> tab (picture below), you can set the distance (in pixels) between the edges of the maximized windows and the edges of the monitor (typically to make room for the applet windows and for clicking on the desktop), specify if the borders apply only to the primary monitor, set the opacity/transparency of the menu, remove the icons from it, and provide Aero-style menus (for Windows Vista and above).<BR><BR>

<IMG src="images/eWorkspaceAero.png" border=0> <BR>On the <B>Menu Editor</B> tab, you can customize the contents of the Desktop menus. <BR>Click on the <B>+</B> sign next to <B>Right</B> to see the default RightClick Desktop menu items (picture below).<BR>You can add, remove <IMG src="images/delete.png">, or modify <IMG src="images/edit.png"> items.<BR><BR>Below are instructions to add a program (i.e. executable). <BR><IMG src="images/emergeWorkspace.png"> <BR>The different types of items which can be added to the Desktop menu are listed in the <B>Type</B>window. They are:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Separator,</LI>
  <LI>Executable(more details on browsing for executables in <A href="emergelauncher.html">emergeLauncher</A>),</LI>
  <LI>Internal Command, with the list of available commands in the <B>Value</B> window,</LI>
  <LI>Date Time. See Documentation in the <B><I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)">Emerge Desktop</I></B>program group (Programs in Start Menu) for the different formats that can be entered in the <B>Value</B> window,</LI>
  <LI>Special Folders, with the choice of My Computer, My Network Places, Control Panel, Recycle Bin or My Documents in the <B>Value</B> window,</LI>
  <LI>Submenu, which, after clicking on the Save button <IMG src="images/save.png">, is populated with any type of items by clicking on the + sign, highlighting an item inside the submenu, and clicking on the Add Menu Item button <IMG src="images/add.png"> for each additional item,</LI>
  <LI>Folder menu, to show any folder in an Explorer window,</LI>
  <LI>Tasks menu, to display the currently running programs,</LI>
  <LI>Settings menu, to display the <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> Settings menu.</LI>
</UL>

The order of the items can be changed by dragging them up or down past other items in the Menu Editor 
window.<BR><BR>The MiddleClick Desktop menu is activated by clicking the mouse's 
middle button on the desktop.<BR><BR>To modify it, click on the + sign next to 
<B>Middle</B> in this configuration dialog box and follow the same instructions 
as above.<BR><BR><B></B>2. <B>Edit Launch Applets</B> (picture below), which is 
where the applets executed when <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge 
Desktop</B></I> is loaded are listed. <BR><BR>This is where you can add and 
remove applets from your <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge 
Desktop</B></I> configuration. <BR><BR>

To add a new applet - in this example, emergeHotkeys (an applet which lets you use keyboard shortcuts to start 
programs, etc.), follow the instructions on the picture below.<BR><BR>

Note on step 2: After the browsing window opens, double-click &quot;emergeHotkeys&quot; and 
proceed with step 3. <BR><IMG src="images/LaunchApplets.png" border=0> 
<BR><BR>When you click on the Start Applet button <IMG src="images/start.png"> in step 5, the applet is executed (or loaded). Instructions on how to configure emergeHotkeys are further in this tutorial.<BR><BR>

To stop an applet (i.e. go from loaded to unloaded state), highlight it in the Applet window and click on  the Stop Applet button <IMG src="images/stop.png">.<BR>To delete an applet (i.e. 
remove it from this configuration dialog box only), highlight it in the Applet 
window and click on the Delete Launch Applet button <IMG src="images/delete.png"> .<BR>Descriptions of all the <I 
style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> dialog box buttons are 
<A href="dialog-buttons.html">here</A>. <BR>3. <B>Edit Aliases<BR></B><BR>See <A

further in the tutorial (shortcut <A

which is where you can switch back to the Explorer shell.<BR><BR>(From the 
Explorer shell, you can switch back to <I 
style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> by clicking on Start 
&gt; Programs &gt; Emerge Desktop &gt; Emerge Desktop Shell 
Changer.)<BR><BR>Switching takes place after rebooting or logging off and back 
on.<BR><BR>6. <B>Quit Emerge Desktop</B>, which is used to close all <I 
style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> applets. (One easy way 
to restart <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> is to 
press Ctrl-Shift-Esc, which brings up the Task Manager, then select Menu &gt; 
New Task (Run...), browse to C:\Program Files\Emerge Desktop\emergeCore.exe, and 
click Ok.)<BR>
The <B>Help</B> menu consists of:<BR><BR>
<B>Offline Help</B>, also accessible in the <I style="COLOR: rgb(106,168,79)"><B>Emerge Desktop</B></I> program group,<BR><BR>
this <B>Online Tutorial</B>, <B>Emerge Desktop Website</B>, which includes a forum, and<BR><BR><B>About</B>, which
