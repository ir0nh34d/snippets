<h2>Configuration of emergeLauncher</h2>

EmergeLauncher is used to launch programs by clicking on their respective icons.<br>
<br>
To configure emergeLauncher, Ctrl-right-click its window and click on Configure,<br>
      
<img src="images/eLauncherConfigure.png">
      
<p>and you get the dialog box below.</p>
      
<img src="images/eLauncherBoxGeneral.png"><br>

The settings on the General tab allow you to:<br>
      
<ul>
<li>snap the window position to the edges of the monitor and of the other windows, </li>
<li>snap the size of the window to other windows next to it, </li>
<li>automatically size the window around the icons,</li>
<li>switch the &quote;clickable&quote; area from the window to whatever is behind it if you check Click Through and select Full.

Important notes: To click on an icon in this setting, you must Shift-click it. To access the applet's menu in this setting, you must Shift-Ctrl-right-click the window instead of just Ctrl-right-click. Likewise, to move it you must Shift-Ctrl-click the window, and to resize it you must Shift-Alt-click a border.
</li>
<li>or switch the &quote;clickable&quote; area from the window's background to whatever is behind it, but still keep the icons (and the border) themselves &quote;clickable&quote; if you check Click Through and select
Background. Important notes: To access the window's menu with this setting, you must Ctrl-right-click an icon or the border, not the background. Likewise, to move the window you must either Ctrl-click an icon or the border, and you still can resize the window by Alt-clicking a border,</li>
<li>set the spacing between the icons,</li>
<li>select their size.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>The Launch Items tab (picture below) is where you add, modify or remove programs, commands and other features in emergeLauncher.</p>

      
<p>Follow the instructions on that picture to add a program, command, etc. </p>

Note on Step 3: For each program (executable) that you want to add to emergeLauncher, you have to browse to find its executable file.<br>

They are usually located in the folder &quote;C:\Program Files\[said-program folder]&quote;. <br>

If the executable file's exe extension is not visible, you can usually recognize it because its name and icon are the same as the program's. <br>

Double-click this file and continue with Step 4.<br>

<br>
You can also specify the working directory (folder), change the icon, or add a tip (e.g. the name of the program), which will appear when you hover the mouse over the icon.<br>
<br>
The buttons on the right side of the Applications window beside <img src="images/Add.png"> Add Item are: <img src="images/Edit.png"> Edit,<img src="images/Delete.png"> Delete, <img src="images/Up.png"> Move up, <img src="images/Down.png"> Move down the highlighted item in the Application window.<br>
<br>
To create an uncluttered window, beside increasing the value in Icon Spacing, you can add Separators between some of the icons:<br>

Click the <img src="images/Add.png"> Add Item button, choose Separator in Type, then the Style of your choice.<br>

You can then move the Separator between icons by using the Up <img src="images/Up.png> and Down <img src="images/Down.png"> buttons.<br>

The Position tab (picture below) allows you to:<br>
      
<ul>
        <li>anchor the window to the monitor location of your choice,<br>
        </li>
        <li>set the window as always on the top, in normal position, or always under other windows (ZPosition),</li>
        <li>set the icons' direction vertically (column of icons) or horizontally (row of icons), and</li>
        <li>set the horizontal and vertical alignments of icons within the border.</li>
</ul>
